In the initial code, several changes have been made to enhance the functionality and maintainability of the RecipeApp.

Firstly, the Recipe and Ingredient classes have been modified to use generic collections (List<T>) instead of arrays, allowing for dynamic resizing and easier manipulation of data.

Secondly, exception handling has been added to handle potential errors when parsing user input for choices, quantities, and factors.

Additionally, new features have been implemented, including the ability to enter multiple recipes, display recipes in alphabetical order, scale recipes by a given factor, reset recipes to their original quantities, and clear recipes entirely.

Overall, these changes improve the functionality, usability, and maintainability of the RecipeApp, making it more versatile and user-friendly.
